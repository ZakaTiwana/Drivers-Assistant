## Summary
Driving a car on the road is a serious job and requires 100% focus from the driver. A little
loss in focus can sometimes result in serious injury and loss of human life. Road Accidents are one
of the largest contributors to deaths and injuries every year. Unless a serious action is taken, road
traffic injuries are predicted to become the fifth leading cause of death by 2030 [1]. Our proposed
system is going to help minimize that problem. Furthermore, while driving it gets a lot easier for the
driver if there is some assistance provided to the driver in finding the destination he wants to reach.

Our system, which will be an android application that the user will install on its phone/tablet. Our
system is going to help minimize accidents on the road by detecting vehicles in front of the user’s
car using a camera and measure distance between the user’s and other vehicles in front. If that
distance crosses a certain minimum limit, it will generate a warning and will be able to alert the user
before it gets too late. Moreover, it will keep the user aware of any traffic placed signs along the
road to enable him to drive more safely. Furthermore, if will also provide an accident detection
feature in case an accident does occur. It will ask the user for his trusted contacts information and if
an accident does occur, it will inform the user’s trusted contacts about it and his location.
Additionally it will help the user in finding his destination in a better and precise way by
augmenting direction arrows on a live video feed of the car’s front.
